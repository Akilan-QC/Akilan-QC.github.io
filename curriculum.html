		<h1> Curriculum Vitae</h1>
		<h2>Postdoc 3 (June 2024)</h2>
		<p>
			I will be joining as a postdoc in ICGM UMR 5253, Montpelier. The primary job of the project will be
			designing an optimal implementation of Q-DFT in quantum devices and implementing them in BigDFT code.
		</p>
		<h2> Postdoc 2 (May 2023 - April 2024)</h2>
		<p>
			I was engaged in a research project titled "Rebirth of Aromatic Cope Rearrangements",
			under the guidance of Prof. Eric HENON in ICMR UMR 7312, URCA, Reims.
			This project involved collaboration with two distinct
			experimental groups. My work primarily revolved around utilizing quantum mechanical tools to investigate
			the impact of metal catalysts, various solvents, and functional groups on reaction mechanisms.
			Additionally, as a side endeavor, I was developing a promolecular density model that will be integrated
			into IGMplot (a versatile quantum mechanics tool capable of identifying and quantifying molecular
			interactions). Furthermore, I contributed to the implementation of Slater Type Orbitals (STO) within
			the IGMplot framework. Lastly, I employed machine learning techniques to predict interaction energies using
			descriptors derived from the promolecular density analysis.
		</p>
		<h2> Postdoc 1 (April 2021 - September 2022)</h2>
		<p>
			In my first postdoc, I was working on the heterogeneous reactions of Ozone and Sulphur dioxide on the
			surface of atmospheric aerosols using molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and QM/MM approach. The project
			was supervised by Prof. Celine TOUBIN and Dr. Denis DUFLOT in PhLAM UMR 8523, Universite de Lille.
			During my one and a half
			year of postdoctoral period in Lille, I also developed a graphical user interface with python (tkinter) and
			bash scripts, that connects two programmes for calculating reaction rates.
		</p>
		<h2> PhD in Physics (November 2016 - January 2021)</h2>
		<p>
			I completed my PhD in January 2021 under the guidance of Dr. R. Shankar in department of Physics,
			Bharathiar University, Coimbatore. My PhD
			thesis is entitled "The First Principle and Quantum Chemical Modelling of Carbon, Boron,
			Nitrogen and Silicon-Based Two-Dimensional Adsorbent Materials for Energy Harvesting
			Applications". In my PhD, I worked on Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen and Silicon-based Two-Dimensional materials as
			electrodes using Quantum chemical tools such as Gaussian, Quantum
			espresso and VASP. Further, I studied the defects of structures, adsorption and diffusion
			properties of Metal-ions, and molecules on the surface of electrodes. Furthermore, I also
			studied the electronic properties (using electron density studies such as AIM and ELF) of
			stacked Two-Dimensional materials and excited states using DFT and TD-DFT respectively. I
			had collaboration with people who are working on Atmospheric chemistry, DNA-ligand
			interaction, Drug delivery, DNA sensing, thermoelectric, supercapacitors and metal-ion
			batteries, and our work is published in reputed journals.
		</p>
		<h2> M.Sc and B.Sc (June 2011 - April 2016)</h2>
		<p>
			I completed my M.Sc (Physics) and B.Sc (Physics) from St. Joseph's college, Trichy, TN, India. During my masters, I get
			the opportunity to study classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electrodynamics,
			Mathematical physics and Electronics. Further, I did master's project on "Structural and optical properties
			of Tin and Fluorine doped Zinc oxide thin films by spin coating method".<br>
			In my bachelor degree, I studied classical mechanics, physical chemistry, chemistry, Math and C++.
		</p>
		<h2> High School (June 2004 - April 2011)</h2>
		<p>
			I pursued my schooling from St. Antony's Higher secondary school, which is in my home village Kosavapatty in Dindigul
			, TN, India.
		</p>
		<h3> Skills</h3>
		<p>
			I have solid experience with the following quantum chemistry codes: Gaussian, Quantum espresso and VASP. <br>
			and molecular dynamics code: Gromacs. I have published at least one article using each of the mentioned codes.<br>
			I have good experience with Python and bash scripting.
			Moreover, I have more than eight years of experience in handling high performance computers (HPCs).
		</p>
		<h4> Awards</h4>
		<p>
			I was awarded senior research fellowship (SRF) by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India
		</p>
		<h5> Events</h5>
